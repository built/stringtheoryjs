Long ago there was a development tool for Java named StringTheory(tm).
It didn't do terribly well in the marketplace, but it was a handy little
library. Over the years it has been ported to a couple of other languages.
This is a very rough sketch of what the final StringTheory for Javascript
will be like. 

Feedback is begged for. Even if this sucks, if you can articulate WHY it 
sucks, that would be very useful to hear about. Politely, of course! :)
